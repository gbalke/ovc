## Hardware and Firmware

The design files for both hardware and firmware can be found in the [main OVC repository](https://github.com/osrf/ovc).

Each OVC version has its own subdirectory with firmware, hardware and software, for example OVC5 files can be found [here](https://github.com/osrf/ovc/tree/master/ovc5).

[KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) is recommended for the hardware schematics files.
